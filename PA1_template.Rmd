## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
By linearity of sums, mean daily steps is the sum of the mean in each interval: 

'''{r}
# get mean across all days for each interval, ignoring NAs: 
DI <- ddply(DA,"interval",function(D){mean(D$steps,na.rm=TRUE)})
MeanStepsPerDay <- sum(DI$V1)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
